# 2D_Truss_System_FEM_Analysis
A 2D Truss System FEM Analysis script

This simple file will conduct 2D Truss System Structural Analysis using Finite Element Methods.

E = Elasticity Modulus in MPA A = Cross section area in meters squared, though leaving it all as 1 in all elements if they have the same cross-section area
